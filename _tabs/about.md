I am <span style="color:blue">**k4n3ki**</span> a.k.a. Suraj Yadav. I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at IITR. I usually play CTFs as part of team [**InfoSecIITR**](https://infoseciitr.in/). I am interested in Reverse engineering Malwares.

You can view my Resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_M1R-MJtzt9gcCIgFflI4urtsTVAJeJ/view?usp=sharing).

Other than malware samples i am trying to understand world.
I like anime and travelling.
