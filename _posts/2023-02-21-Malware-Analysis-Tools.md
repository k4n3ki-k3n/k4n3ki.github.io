## <span style ="color:red;"> CFF Explorer </span> 
- Serves as a hex editor.
- Enables editing of resource sections, adding imports, and signature scanning.
- Allows for binary rebuilding.
- Includes UPX utility for packing/unpacking executables.
- Features an inbuilt Dependency Walker.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Detect It Easy </span>
- Identifies the compiler, packer, and linker used, along with signatures.
- Provides information on the entry point, base address, headers, sections, imports, and resources.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Office MalScanner </span> 
- A free command-line tool for detecting malicious code in Microsoft Office documents.
- Capable of locating shellcode, embedded PE files, and OLE streams in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files.
- Can decompress newer Microsoft Office document formats.

## <span style ="color:red;"> PEiD </span> 
- Utilized for detecting packers and compilers.
- Its most valuable plugin, <span style ="color:blue;">Krypto ANALyzer</span>, identifies common cryptographic algorithms in PE files and allows for exporting this information to IDA Pro.

## <span style ="color:red;"> PEView </span>
- A tool for examining PE file structures, including the PE header, individual sections, and import/export tables.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Resource Hacker </span>
- A utility for viewing, renaming, modifying, adding, deleting, and extracting resources in PE-formatted binaries.
- Particularly useful for extracting shellcode, malware, DLLs, or drivers from the resource section at runtime, allowing for analysis without executing the malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> API Monitor </span>
- Enables monitoring and control of API calls made by applications and services.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Autoruns </span>
- Searches various locations (registry, startup folders, etc.) for persistence and reports findings through a GUI.

## <span style ="color:red;"> IDA Pro and Hex Ray Decompiler </span>
- IDA Pro is the leading disassembler for malware analysis.
- Hex-Rays Decompiler converts assembly code into human-readable, C-like pseudocode.

## <span style ="color:red;"> WinDBG </span>
- Used for debugging user-mode, kernel-mode, x86, and x64 malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> OllyDBG </span>
- A user-mode x86 debugger with a GUI.
- Features numerous plugins to enhance functionality.
- Originally developed by Immunity Security Company and rebranded as Immunity Debugger (ImmDBG).

## <span style ="color:red;"> Process Hacker </span>
- A powerful task manager that provides insights into currently running processes.
- Capable of scanning for strings and regular expressions in memory, injecting or unloading DLLs, loading drivers, and starting services.
- Similar tools include Process Explorer and Process Monitor, but with fewer features.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Regshot </span>
- Allows for taking and comparing two registry snapshots before and after running malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Wireshark </span>
- Captures network traffic generated by malware for protocol analysis.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Tor </span>
- Recommended for safe network connections during malware analysis, such as checking IP addresses or searching for information.

## <span style ="color:red;"> TCPView </span>
- Provides a detailed graphical listing of all TCP and UDP endpoints on the system, showing which process owns each endpoint.

## <span style ="color:red;"> ApateDNS </span>
- Acts as a fake DNS server, spoofing DNS responses to a user-specified IP address by listening on UDP port 53 on the localhost.
