In this post, I will list most of the tools that i use during analysing Malware samples.

#### <span style = "color:red;">List of tools discussed below:</span> 
<span style="color:pink">For Static analysis</span>
- CFF Explorer
- Detect It Easy
- Office Malscanner
- PEiD
- Resource Hacker
- API Monitor

<span style="color:pink">For Dynamic analysis</span>
- Autoruns
- IDA Pro and Hex Ray Decompiler
- WinDBG
- OllyDBG
- Process Hacker
- Regshot

<span style="color:pink">For Network analysis</span>
- Wireshark
- Tor
- TCPView
- ApateDNS 

## <span style ="color:red;"> CFF Explorer </span> 
- Can be used as hex editor. 
- Useful for editing resource sections, adding imports, scanning for signatures. 
- Rebuild the binary. 
- UPX utility to pack/unpack the executable. 
- Inbuilt Dependency Walker.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Detect It Easy </span>
- It detects, the compiler, packer and linker used, signatures.
- It tells entry point, base address, header, sections, imports, resources.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Office MalScanner </span> 
- Free command-line tool for finding malicious code in Microsoft office documents. 
- It can locate shellcode, embedded PE files and OLE streams in Excel, Word and Powerpoint documents. 
- Can decompress the newer format of Microsoft Office documents.

## <span style ="color:red;"> PEiD </span> 
- Used for packer and compiler detection. 
- PEiD's most useful plugin <span style="color:blue">Krypto ANALyzer </span> can be used to find common cryptographic algorithms in PE files and provides the ability to export the information to IDA Pro.

## <span style ="color:red;"> PEView </span>
- Tool for viewing PE file structures like PE header, individual sections and the import/export tables.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Resource Hacker </span>
- Utility for viewing, renaming, modifying, adding, deleting, and extracting resources for PE-formatted binaries. 
- Very useful because malware often exracts shellcode/malwares, DLLs or driver from its resource section at runtime, we can easily extract those sections without running the malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> API Monitor </span>
- lets you monitor and control API calls made by applications and services

## <span style ="color:red;"> Autoruns </span>
- It searches for the various possible locations (registry, startup folders, and so on) for <span style="color:blue">persistence</span> and reports to you in a GUI.

## <span style ="color:red;"> IDA Pro and Hex Ray Decompiler </span>
- IDA Pro is the most widely used disassembler for malware analysis.
- Hex ray decompiler convert assembly code into human-readable, C-like pseudocode text.

## <span style ="color:red;"> WinDBG </span>
- It can be used to debug user-mode, kernel-mode, x86 and x64 malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> OllyDBG </span>
- It is a user-mode x86 debugger with GUI.
- Many plug-ins are available that extend its capabilities.
- It's code base was by Immunity Security Company and rebranded as Immunity Debugger(ImmDBG).

## <span style ="color:red;"> Process Hacker </span>
- It is a powerful task managerthat provides insight into processes currently running on system.
- It can scan for strings, regular expressions in memory, inject or unload DLL, load a driver, create or start a service and so on.
- Process Explorer and Process Monitor are similar tools but with less functionalities.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Regshot </span>
- It allow to take and compare two registry snapshots before and after running the malware.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Wireshark </span>
- It can be used to capture network traffic generated by malware and to analyze different protocols.

## <span style ="color:red;"> Tor </span>
- You are not recommended to connect to network during malware analysis but if you have to, then use Tor.
- Use it during analysis, such as checking IP addresses, performing internet searches, accessing domains, or looking for important information.

## <span style ="color:red;"> TCPView </span>
- It is for graphically detailed listing of all TCP and UDP endpoints on your system.
- It allows you to see which *process own a given endpoint*.

## <span style ="color:red;"> ApateDNS </span>
- As a phony DNS server, ApateDNS spoofs DNS responses to a user-specified IP address by listing on UDP port 53 on the localhost machine.
