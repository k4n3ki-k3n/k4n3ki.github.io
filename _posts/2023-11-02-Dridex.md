# <span style="color:red">Overview</span>

DRIDEX is a well-known and long-lasting type of <span style="color:lightgreen">banking Trojan</span> that first emerged in late 2014. It's notorious for targeting banks and financial institutions to steal sensitive information like banking details and user credentials. Usually, Dridex spreads through phishing emails, often using Word or Excel files that have harmful VBA macros.

The APT group called <span style="color:lightgreen">TA505</span> is notorious for its involvement in various cyber threats, including Dridex, as well as other well-known malware like <span style="color:lightgreen">TrickBot</span> and the destructive <span style="color:lightgreen">Locky ransomware</span>.

Dridex tries to avoid being detected and analyzed. It does this by hiding its actions when communicating with Windows, and it uses a technique called "string hashing" to make it more challenging for security researchers to understand what it's doing. It also uses a method called "Vectored Exception Handling" to further complicate its analysis.

## <span style="color:red">Detect-it-Easy</span>

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/die.jpg">

To obtain general information about the executable, load the file into DiE, where you can find the compilation date of the binary, which is September 19, 2020. It is a PE32 binary and includes only two imports: <span style="color:lightgreen">OutputDebugStringA</span> and <span style="color:lightgreen">Sleep</span>. Properties such as a low number of strings and high entropy (e.g., .rdata: 7.76, .text: 6.5) suggest that this binary may be packed.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/entropy.jpg">

## <span style="color:red">Virustotal</span>

Searching the MD5 hash on VirusTotal yielded a report where 53 out of 70 antivirus vendors flagged it as malicious. The hash was associated with the <span style="color:lightgreen">Dridex</span>, <span style="color:lightgreen">Graftor</span>, and <span style="color:lightgreen">Cridex</span> family tags. You can review the detailed report [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f9495e968f9a1610c0cf9383053e5b5696ecc85ca3ca2a338c24c7204cc93881).

### <span style="color:red">Yara detection</span>
- Detects aPLib decompression code often used in malware
- Dridex v4 dropper C2 parsing function
- Heaven's Gate: Switch from 32-bit to 64-mode

### <span style="color:red">Sigma detection</span>
- Detects suspicious calls of DLLs in rundll32.dll exports by ordinal
- Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code
- Code integrity failures may indicate tampered executables.

## <span style="color:red">Capa</span>

[capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa/tree/master) detects capabilities in executable files. You run it against a PE, ELF, .NET module, or shellcode file and it tells you what it thinks the program can do. 

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/capa.jpg">

The report reveals several key insights, including the use of string encryption, anti-disassembly techniques, and PE parsing.

## <span style="color:red">PEiD</span>

To determine the packer and encryption algorithm used for string encryption, you can employ PEiDs plugin <span style="color:lightgreen">KANAL</span>. [PEiD](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Packers-Crypters-Protectors/PEiD-updated.shtml) is an intuitive application that relies on its user-friendly interface to detect packers, cryptors and compilers found in PE executable files â€“ its detection rate is higher than that of other similar tools since the app packs more than 600 different signatures in PE files.

It detects the use of CRC32, Base64, and aPLib algorithms.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/peid.jpg">

# <span style="color:red">Technical Analysis</span>

To conduct further analysis, load the binary into IDA Pro. Inside IDA Pro, we observe that the binary passes certain hashes as arguments to a function and subsequently invokes the returned values as if they were functions. This suggests that the binary is likely resolving API functions dynamically. 

The first argument in both calls to the function <span style="color:lightgreen">sub_6015C0</span> is identical, indicating that it likely represents the hash of a DLL module.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/dllentry.jpg">

To identify the implementation of the algorithm being used, let's analyze the function sub_6015C0.

## <span style="color:red">API hashing</span>

The function sub_607564 takes the dllHash as input and parses through the PEB (Process Environment Block) structure to retrieve the base name of the module associated with the hash.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/peb.jpg">

It iterates through all the modules, computes the <span style="color:lightgreen">RC4</span> hash of their base names, performs an <span style="color:lightgreen">XOR</span> operation with the value <span style="color:lightgreen">0x38BA5C7B</span>, and subsequently compares this result with the dllHash.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/cmpHash.jpg">

With knowledge of the algorithm name and XOR key, we can utilize "HashDB," which is an API hash lookup plugin for IDA Pro.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/hashdb.jpg">

To perform a HashDB lookup, simply right-click on a hash and select the "HashDB Lookup" option.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/usehashdb.jpg">

Appgate has created a [script](https://github.com/appgate/labs/blob/master/dridex/ida/ida_resolve_apis.py) which which resolves API calls automatically and inserts a comment where the function is called, so we can easily search where in the code certain DLLs or APIs are being used. 

```python

                    except:
                        continue

        return "{}!unknown".format(item['name'])

def resolve_apis(resolver_offset, hashes_table, xor_key):
    for xref in idautils.XrefsTo(resolver_offset):
        off = idc.prev_head(xref.frm)
        # This loop will search for the hash that is being passed by the function
        # It's limited to 100 searches to avoid possible infinite loops.
        dll, api = None, None
        for i in range(1, 101):
            if i == 100:
                print("[-] Cannot find hash for address: %s" % hex(xref.frm))
                break
            # If it's not a "push" operation, keep looking
            if idc.print_insn_mnem(off) != "push":
                off = idc.prev_head(off)
                continue
            # If a "push" is identified, checks if it's the DLL or the API hash
            if not dll:
                dll = hex(idc.get_operand_value(off, 0))
                off = idc.prev_head(off)
                continue
            # If the DLL was already found, then the second push is the API hash
            api_name = api_resolver(dll, hex(idc.get_operand_value(off, 0)), hashes_table, xor_key)
            comment = "Unknown" if not api_name else api_name
            idc.set_cmt(xref.frm, comment, True)

# ---------------------- Main ---------------------- #
def main(xor_key, resolver_function):
    hashes = generate_hashes_table(xor_key)
    resolve_apis(resolver_function, hashes, xor_key)

main(0x38BA5C7B, 0x6015C0)
```

I have adjusted the function address and XOR key to match our specific sample.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/apiscript.jpg">

## <span style="color:red">Vectored Exception Handler(INT 3)</span>

Now that the APIs are resolved, we have noticed that in many instances, after obtaining the address of the resolved API, the code has been modified to include "int3" instructions, designed to trap a debugger. The presence of "int3" instructions can complicate dynamic analysis since debuggers often use "int3" for setting breakpoints.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/int3.jpg">

Instead of using a "call" instruction to invoke the resolved APIs, the program registers sub_687D40 as an exception handler through the RtlAddVectoredExceptionHandler API. This implies that when the program encounters an "int3" instruction, the kernel invokes sub_687D40 to manage the interrupt and transfer control to the API stored in the EAX register.

Once the handler returns the EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION code, the user thread's context is reinstated, and the malware resumes execution from the "retn" instruction.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/eip.jpg">

To improve the flow graph and eliminate these debugger traps, I discovered this script from [LEXFO's blog](https://blog.lexfo.fr/dridex-malware.html).

```python
from idaapi import get_segm_by_name
from idc import patch_byte, add_bpt, set_bpt_cond, BPT_EXEC, load_and_run_plugin
import ida_search

load_and_run_plugin("idapython", 3)


def find_all_occurences(start, end, bin_str, flags):
    occurences = list()
    ea = start
    while ea <= end:
        occurence = ida_search.find_binary(ea, end, bin_str, 0, flags)
        ea = occurence + 1
        occurences.append(occurence)
    return occurences[0:-1]


def patch_binary():
    segment = get_segm_by_name('.text')
    occurences = find_all_occurences(segment.start_ea, segment.end_ea, "CC C3", ida_search.SEARCH_DOWN)

    datas = [0xFF, 0xD0]
    for occurence in occurences:
        for i, byte in enumerate(datas):
            patch_byte(occurence + i, byte)
    return True
```

Although the original script is intended for IDAPython 6.x, I have made modifications to make it compatible with IDAPython 7.x, referencing the changes from this article : [Porting from IDAPython 6.x-7.3, to 7.4](https://hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ida74_idapython_no_bc695_porting_guide.shtml).

## <span style="color:red">String Decryption</span>

The binary contains <span style="color:lightgreen">encrypted strings</span> in the <span style="color:lightgreen">.rdata</span> section, and Capa suggests that these strings are encrypted using <span style="color:lightgreen">RC4</span>. By examining their cross-references (xref), we can understand how they are decoded.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/string_key.jpg">


In the image provided, it is evident that the first 40 bytes serve as the key to decrypt the subsequent bytes within the function <span style="color:lightgreen">sub_61E5D0</span>.

We can confirm this by attempting to decrypt the hexadecimal bytes using a tool like <span style="color:lightgreen">CyberChef</span>.

<img src="/assets/img/dridex/cyberchef.jpg">

## <span style="color:red">IOC Extraction</span>

Appgate has released a [Tool](https://github.com/appgate/labs/tree/master/dridex/toolkit) to Extract the <span style="color:lightgreen">Botnet ID</span>, <span style="color:lightgreen">C2 IP Adresses</span>, <span style="color:lightgreen">Decrypted string</span>, <span style="color:lightgreen">Decrypt Network Communication</span> from the dridex sample.
