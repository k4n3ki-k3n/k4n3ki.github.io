```
Can you reverse this Windows Binary?
```
The challenge binary can be downloaded from [here]](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/0ef5d0d6d552cd5e0bd60c2adbddaa94/win-exec-1.exe).

> Hint1 : Microsoft provides windows virtual machines https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines

> Hint2 : Ollydbg may be helpful

> Hint3 : Flag format: PICOCTF{XXXX}

# <span style = "color:red;">Solution</span>

The first step involves checking the binary type and executing it in the terminal.
![runBinary](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/runBinary.jpg)

The binary is identified as a PE32 executable. It prompts the user for two inputs, and if the provided key is incorrect, it displays the message: <span style="color: lightgreen;">*"Incorrect key. Try again."*</span>

Next, the executable is opened in IDA (Interactive DisAssembler) for further analysis.

Upon examining the strings section, one string particularly caught attention.

![xrefStrings](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/xrefStringsView.jpg)

The function where this string was utilized was examined through cross-references, revealing that it was being appended to other strings to complete a flag.

![functionPrintingView](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/functionPrintingView.jpg)

Retracing the steps to the cross-references of this function revealed a series of interconnected function calls.
> sub_401F05 -> sub_408010 -> sub_403F21 -> sub_407F20 -> sub_401028 -> sub_407E80

![functionCall](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/functionCall.jpg)

In this context, the function sub_401F05 is called after a function that resembles a print operation, using the argument <span style = "color : lightgreen;">"Correct input. Printing flag:"</span>.

If there is a way to invoke this function, it will result in the flag being printed.

The function can be invoked using two methods:

## <span style = "color:red;">1. Patching the Binary in IDA</span>

The binary was modified in IDA by altering the instruction from <span style="color:lightgreen;">jnz short loc_408137</span> to <span style="color:lightgreen;">jmp short loc_408137</span>. This change ensures that the function is called regardless of the input provided.

![idaPatched](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/idaPatched.jpg)

The patched binary can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/0xk4n3ki/CTF-Write-ups/blob/main/win-exec-1.exe?raw=true).


## <span style = "color:red;">2. Dynamic Analysis Using OllyDbg</span>

The binary can be loaded in OllyDbg, and navigation to the desired address can be accomplished by pressing *Ctrl+G*.

![jumpToAddress](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/jumpToAddress.jpg)

A breakpoint should be set at address <span style="color:lightgreen"> 0xfa8108 </span>. Once the program is executed, it will prompt for input.

![ollydbgStarted](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/ollydbgStarted.jpg)

After providing any valid input, the program will halt at the breakpoint. By stepping over the instructions, it can be observed at address 0xFA8112 that the value of <span style="color:lightgreen">EAX</span> is 00000000. Consequently, the jump will be executed based on the value of the zero register.

![eaxIsZero](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/eaxIsZero.jpg)

By simply changing the value of EAX and continuing execution, the flag will be printed successfully.

> The flag is : <span style = "color:lightgreen;">*PICOCTF{These are the access codes to the vault: 1063340}*</span>
