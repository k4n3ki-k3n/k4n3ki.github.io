# B1ll_Gat35

## Description
```
Can you reverse this Windows Binary?
```
 Download the [Binary](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/0ef5d0d6d552cd5e0bd60c2adbddaa94/win-exec-1.exe)

### Hint1
Microsoft provides windows virtual machines https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines

### Hint2
Ollydbg may be helpful

### Hint3
Flag format: PICOCTF{XXXX}

## Solution

First we check the type of binary and run it in terminal.
![runBinary](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/runBinary.jpg)

Its a PE32 executable. It takes two input from user and if key is not correct, it outputs <span style="color: lightgreen;">*Incorrect key. Try again.*</span>

Lets open it in IDA.
![idaView](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/idaView.jpg)

When i looked into the strings section, one string particularly attracted my sight.
![xrefStrings](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/xrefStringsView.jpg)

I checked the function it was used in using xref, it was appending it with other strings, like completing the flag.
![functionPrintingView](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/functionPrintingView.jpg)

I moved back where this function was xref to, its a chain of function calls. 
> sub_401F05 -> sub_408010 -> sub_403F21 -> sub_407F20 -> sub_401028 -> sub_407E80

![](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/functionCall.jpg)

Here we can see that function sub_401F05 is called after the function that looks like print call with the argument <span style = "color : lightgreen;"> "Correct input. Printing flag: "</span>.

So if we somehow manage to call this function, it will print the flag.

## one way to patch binary in IDA
I patched the binary in ida, by changing the instruction <span style="color:lightgreen;">jnz short loc_408137 </span> to <span style="color:lightgreen;"> jmp short loc_408137</span>, it will call the function no matter what input you give.

Download the patched [Binary](https://github.com/0xk4n3ki/CTF-Write-ups/blob/main/win-exec-1.exe?raw=true).


## Dynamic attempt using Ollydbg
Load the binary in Ollydbg, and jump to address by clicking *ctrl+G*.

![jumpToAddress](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/jumpToAddress.jpg)

Set the breakpoint at <span style="color:lightgreen"> 0xfa8108 </span>, and run the program, it will ask for the input.

![ollydbgStarted](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/ollydbgStarted.jpg)

Provide any valid input and it will stop at the breakpoint.Step over the instructions and at 0xFA8112 you can see the <span style="color:lightgreen">EAX=00000000</span>, and jump will be taken according to the value of zero register.

![eaxIsZero](/assets/img/20230103/billgates/eaxIsZero.jpg)

So just change the value of EAX, and continue execution.

Voila!, it will print the flag for ya.

> The flag is : *PICOCTF{These are the access codes to the vault: 1063340}*
