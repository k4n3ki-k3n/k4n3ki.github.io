These Labs are from Chapter 17(<span style="color:red">Anti-Virtual Machine Techniques</span>) for practice from the book <span style="color:lightgreen">“Practical Malware Analysis”</span> written by <span style="color:lightgreen">Michael Sikorski</span> and <span style="color:lightgreen">Andrew Honig</span>.

Tools used:
- IDA Pro
- X32Dbg

# Lab 17-01

> Analyze the malware found in Lab17-01.exe inside VMware. This is the same malware as Lab07-01.exe, with added anti-VMware techniques.

> Note: The anti-VM techniques found in the lab may not work in your environment.

## Question and Answers:

> Question 1: What anti-VM technique does this malware use?

Answer: The malware is using x86 instructions to check whether it is running inside the VM or not.

> Question 2: If you have the commercial version of IDA Pro, run the IDA Python script form Listing 17-4 in chapter 17(provided here as findAntiVm.py). What does it find?

Answer: Given script was using IDA6.x backward APIs which are no longer supported by the newer versions of IDA. SO i changed the older functions with newer ones by using the [hex-rays](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/ida74_idapython_no_bc695_porting_guide.shtml) offical document.

```python
from idautils import *
from idc import *

heads = Heads(get_segm_start(get_screen_ea()), get_segm_end(get_screen_ea()))
antiVM = []
for i in heads:
	if (print_insn_mnem(i) == "sidt" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "sgdt" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "sldt" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "smsw" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "str" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "in" or print_insn_mnem(i) == "cpuid"):
		antiVM.append(i)

print(f"Number of potential Anti-VM instructions: {len(antiVM)}")

for i in antiVM:
	set_color(i, CIC_ITEM, 0x0000ff)
	ida_kernwin.msg("Anti-VM: %08x\n" % i)
```

Load the file into IDA Pro via File -> script file..., choose the script file. It tell us the location of 3 anti-VM techniques used by the malware.

THe instructions detected:
- 0x00401121: <span style="color:lightgreen">sldt(No Pill)</span>
- 0x004011b5: <span style="color:lightgreen">sidt(Red Pill)</span>
- 0x00401204: <span style="color:lightgreen">str</span>

> Question 3: What happens when each anti-VM technique succeeds?

Answer:If sidt and str succeeds then the malware calls a function sub_401000 which deletes the executable. 

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/13.png">

sldt is employed in function sub_401100. If sldt succeeds then the malware exits.

> Question 4: Which of these anti-VM techniques work against your virtual machine?

Answer: I am on VirtualBox, so none of the techniques worked on my system.

> Question 5: Why does each anti-VM technqiue work or fail?

Answer: For sidt, we can check the reason for failure, by setting a breakpoint on 0x4011E6, we can see that the value in ecx is 0x18 not <span style="color:lightgreen">0xFF</span>(the signature for VMware).

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/151.png">

Str instruction is at 0x401204, but the comparison for the returned value is at 0x40122F which also fails as it doesn't return the expected value.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/152.png">

For sldt, we set a breakpoint at 0x4012D1 where it compares the value with 0xDDCC0000 which also fails.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/153.png">

> Question 6: How could you disable these anti-VM techniques and get the malware to run?

Answer: We can manually change the values by setting breakpoints at the cmp instruction or we can NOP-out the anti-VM instructions.


# <span style="color:red">Lab 17-02</span>

> Analyze the malware found in the file Lab17-02.dll inside VMware. After answering the first question in this lab, try to run the installation exports using rundll32.exe and monitor them with a tool like procmon. The following is an example command line for executing the DLL. <br/><br/>
> run dll32.exe Lab17-02.dll, InstallerRT (or InstallSA/InstallSB)

## <span style="color:red">Question and Answers</span>

> Question 1: What are the exports for this DLL?

Answer: Exports functions are : InstallRT, InstallSA, InstallSB, PSLIST, ServiceMain, StartEXS, UninstallRT, UninstallSA, UninstallSB.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/2exports.png">

> Question 2: What happens after the attempted installation using rundll32.exe?

Answer: I tried to run the malware using rundll32.exe, but it just terminated.

```
rundll32.exe Lab17-02.dll, InstallRT
```


> Question 3: Which files are created and what do they contain?

Answer: It created a <span style="color:lightgreen">xinstall.log</span> file in the same directory of the dll.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/2logcontent.png">

> Question 4: What method of anti-VM is in use?

Answer: In sub_10006196, malware queries the VMware backdoor I/O communication port using the magic value VX by using the x86 <span style="color:lightgreen">in</span> instruction. 

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/2technique.png">

By pressing x, we can see the cross-reference of this function. It is used in all the install exports.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/2xref.png">

> Question 5: How could you force the malware to install during runtime?

Answer: To run the malware during runtime, patch the in instruction at 0x100061DB.

> Question 6: How could you permanently disable the anti-VM technique?

Answer: At the starting of every install export, it check for a byte at the end of stream 0ff_10019034. we can use a hex editor to modify the static string in the binary from <span style="color:lightgreen">"[This is DVM]5" to "[This is DVM]0"</span>.

<img src="/assets/img/lab17/26.png">

Alternatively, <span style="color:lightgreen">NOP-out</span> the check in debugger and write the change to disk.

> Question 7: How does each installation export function work?

Answer:

- InstallRT: It retrieves the pid of a process, either <span style="color:lightgreen">iexplore.exe</span> by default or a custom process name passed in as an argument. Then it gets higher privilege by changing token to <span style="color:lightgreen">SeDebugPrivilege</span>. Then it performs <span style="color:lightgreen">DLL injection</span> on the pid retrieved.

- InstallSA: It performs installation via <span style="color:lightgreen">service installation</span>. It uses Irmon or custom string passed in as an argument as the service name.

- InstallSB: It performs installation via service install and DLL injection if the service to overwrite is still running.


# <span style="color:red">Lab 17-03</span>

> Analyze the malware Lab17-03.exe inside VMware. This Lab is similar to Lab12-02.exe, with added anti-VMware techniques.

## <span style="color:red">Question and Answers:</span>

> Question 1: What happens when you run this malware in a virtual machine?

Answer: The malware immediately terminates.

> Question 2: How could you get this malware to run and drop its keylogger?

Answer: We can change the value of zero flag before the jump instruction.

> Question 3: Which anti-VM technique does this malware use?

Answer: 

- in instruction(backdoor I/O communication port)
- Searches for the string "vmware" in registry key "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceClasses"
- checks for common MAC addresses using GetAdaptersInfo
- checking for process name starting with "vmware" by comparing hash
