# <span style="color:red">**Lab 1-1**</span>

I have been learning from the Book <span style="color:red">**Practical Malware Analysis**</span> written by <span style="color:red">Michael Sikorski</span> and <span style="color:red">Andrew Honig</span>. Its a good book, as there are Labs provided at the end of each chapter for practicing your learning.

Here is the walkthrough of first lab of first chapter i.e. <span style="color:red">"Basic Static Techniques"</span>.


```
Question : This Lab uses the files Lab01-01.exe and Lab01-01.dll. Use the tools and techniques described in the chapter to gain information about the files and answer the questions below.
```
You can download the binary and dll from [here](https://github.com/0xk4n3ki/CTF-Write-ups/tree/e85ac9e8f0da5ac4f6a5a9159331edad9b9f6d7e/malware%20labs/Chapter_1L) .

> Q1: Upload the files to http://www.Virustotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?

Dll was flagged malicious by 44 vendors and executable by 50. These were categorised in trojan family.

> Q2: When were these files compiled?

It can be seen on <span style = "color:blue;">Detect-it-Easy</span> that both files were compiled on 2010-12-19 21:46:38, within 1 minute of each other.
To view the compiled date in <span style = "color:blue;">PEView</span>, navigate to **IMAGE_NT_HEADERS > IMAGE_FILE_HEADERS > Time Date Stamp**.

-->
> Q3: Are there any indications that either of these files packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?

<span style = "color:blue;">PEid</span> don't detect any packer in both the files. **Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0** is the compiler that is shown in PEid.

In <span style = "color:blue;">CFF Explorer</span>, we can see the imports clearly, but the less number of imports indicate that it is small program.

-->

> Q4: Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?

We can see the imports using the tools Detect it easy or CFF Explorer.

Function imported by exe:
- <span style = "color:red;">KERNEL32.dll</span> : It handles the memory usage in "Microsoft Windows"
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CLoseHandle</span> : Closes an open object handle.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">UnmapViewOfFile</span> : Unmaps a mapped view of a file from the calling process's address space.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">IsBadReadPtr</span> : Verifies that the calling process has read access to the specified range of memory.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">MapViewOfFile</span> : Maps a view of a file mapping into the address space of a calling process.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CreateFileMappingA</span> : Creates or opens a named or unnamed file mapping object for a specified file.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CreateFileA</span> : Creates or opens a file or I/O device.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">FindCLose</span> : Closes a file search handle opened by the FindFirstFile, FindFirstFileEx, etc.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">FindNextFileA</span> : Continues a file search from a previous call to the FindFirstFile, FindFirstFileEx, or FindFirstFileTransacted functions.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">FindFirstFileA</span> : Searches a directory for a file or subdirectory with a name that matches a specific name.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CopyFileA</span> : Copies an existing file to a new file.
- <span style = "color:red;">MSVCRT.dll</span> : It is a part of the "Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0" and is crucial for most applications to work properly

Functions imported by dll:
- <span style = "color:red;">KERNEL32.dll</span>
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CreateProcessA</span> : Creates a new process and its primary thread. 
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CreateMutexA</span> : Creates or opens a named or unnamed mutex object.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">OpenMutexA</span> : Opens an existing named mutex object.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">CloseHandle</span>
    - <span style = "color:blue">Sleep</span>
- <span style = "color:red;">WS2_32.dll</span> : Used to handle network connections(imports are being imported by ordinal value)
    - <span style = "color:blue;">socket(0x17)</span> : Creates a socket that is bound to a specific transport service provider.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">WSAStartup(0x73)</span> : Initiates use of the Winsock DLL by a process.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">inet_addr(0xb)</span> : Converts a string containing an IPv4 dotted-decimal address into a proper address for the IN_ADDR structure.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">connect(0x4)</span> : Establishes a connection to a specified socket.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">send(0x13)</span> : Sends data on a connected socket.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">shutdown(0x16)</span> : Disables sends or receives on a socket.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">recv(0x10)</span> : Receives data from a connected socket or a bound connectionless socket.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">closesocket(0x3)</span> : Closes an existing socket.
    - <span style = "color:blue;">WSACleanup(0x74)</span> : Terminates use of the Winsock 2 DLL (Ws2_32.dll).
    - <span style = "color:blue;">htons(0x9)</span> : Converts a u_short from host to TCP/IP network byte order.

Executable is importing functions from KERNEL.dll, that are used for opening and manipulating filesystem.

Dll imports Sleep and CreateProcessA from KERNEL32.dll, that are usually used in Backdoors. From WS2_32.dll, it imports functions to connect to internet or an IP to send and receive some data.

> Q5: Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?

Going through the string in the exe, there are some strings that seems intresting, i.e.: <span style = "color:blue;">C:\windows\System32\Kernel132.dll</span>, <span style = "color:blue;">Lab01-01.dll</span>, <span style = "color:blue;">WARNING_THIS_WILL DESTROY_YOUR_MACHINE</span>.

-->

> Q6: What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?

We can clearly see in strings that dll contains an IP address(127.26.152.13) and it imports functions from WS2_32.dll that are required to communicate to it.

-->

> Q7: What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

It's likely to be a <span style="color:blue">Backdoor</span>, as first the exe looks for the C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll, if it doesn't exists then it copies the dll to this location. Dll tries to communicate with the IP 127.26.152.13.
